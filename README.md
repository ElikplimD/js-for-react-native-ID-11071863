✨These tasks saw the use and integration of functions, arrays, etc

## TASK 1 👩‍💻
![task 1](https://github.com/ElikplimD/js-for-react-native-ID-11071863/assets/148700308/b2270e8d-2eac-4a69-9678-13a5745995df)

In task one, the function  to be executed is set such that given a list of numbers; such that, when the number is even it is returned as a square of itself ( if (num % 2 === 0) {
      return num * num;  and for an odd number, it is tripled and returned.
The map function ie, .map(num =>{} is used because it serves the purpose of creating a new set of array by applying the given function on an existing array.


## TASK 2 👩‍💻
![TASK 2](https://github.com/ElikplimD/js-for-react-native-ID-11071863/assets/148700308/11f57509-7650-4ca1-8334-eb6aea8ce678)

From the screenshot above displayed from my console, task 2 is such that it relies on "result numbers" from task one to get it's final result.  The function in task 2 is designed such that when a the  given array of strings are returned, string number one is displayed in small letters (odd numbered strings) and even numbered strings are displayed in Capital letters .


## TASK 3 👩‍💻
![TASK 3](https://github.com/ElikplimD/js-for-react-native-ID-11071863/assets/148700308/ffffe60a-7ab8-4fd7-aa42-0c2b64bf462d)

This task displays a list of the name of original strings listed in task two before the formatArrayStrings function was excecuted on it and the modified names after the execution.
